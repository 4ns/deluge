Installation Instructions:
==========================

First, make sure you have the proper bulid
dependencies installed.  On a normal Debian
or Ubuntu system, those dependencies are:

g++
python-all-dev
python-all version >= 2.4
python-dbus
python-gtk2 version >= 2.9
python-xdg
python-support
libboost-dev >= 1.33.1
libboost-thread-dev
libboost-date-time-dev
libboost-filesystem-dev
libboost-serialization-dev
libssl-dev
zlib1g-dev

But the names of the packages may vary
depending on your OS / distro.

Once you have the needed libraries installed,
build Deluge by running:

	python setup.py build

You shouldn't get any errors.  Then run, as 
root (or by using sudo): 

	python setup.py install

and Deluge will be installed.

You can then run Deluge by executing:

	deluge
	
Notes:

1) On some distributions, boost libraries are 
 renamed to have "-mt" at the end (boost_thread_mt
 instead of boost_thread, for example), the "mt" 
 indicating "multithreaded". In some cases it 
 appears the distros lack symlinks to connect 
 things. The solution is to either add symlinks 
 from the short names to those with "-mt", or to 
 alter setup.py to look for the "-mt" versions.
 
2) After upgrading your Deluge installation, it 
 may fail to start.  If this happens to you, you
 need to remove your ~/.config/deluge directory
 to allow Deluge to rebuild it's configuration
 file.
