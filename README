Contact/Support:
==========================

We have two options available for support:

	Our Forum, at http://forum.deluge-torrent.org
		or
	Our IRC Channel, at #deluge on Freenode

==========================
Installation Instructions:
==========================

First, make sure you have the proper build dependencies installed.  On a normal 
Debian or Ubuntu system, those dependencies are:

g++
make
python-all-dev
python-all version >= 2.4
python-dbus
python-gtk2 version >= 2.9
python-xdg (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pyxdg)
python-support
libboost-dev >= 1.33.1
libboost-thread-dev
libboost-date-time-dev
libboost-filesystem-dev
libboost-serialization-dev
libssl-dev
zlib1g-dev

But the names of the packages may vary depending on your OS / distro.

Once you have the needed libraries installed, build Deluge by running:

	$ make

You shouldn't get any errors.  Then run, as root (or by using sudo): 

	$ make install

and Deluge will be installed.  By default, Deluge will be installed to the
prefix /usr.  If you wish, you can install Deluge to a different prefix by
specifying it when you install it:

	$ PREFIX=yourprefixhere make install

So, to install to /usr/local, run:

	$ PREFIX=/usr/local make install

You can then run Deluge by executing:

	$ deluge

==========================
Uninstallation/Upgrading:
==========================

If you wish to upgrade from the older Deluge version please remove it first, 
then install the latest version as per "Installation Instructions". If you 
installed via the tarball, cd into the unpacked source tarball and then run, 
as root (or by using sudo): 

	$ make uninstall

If you installed via the deb package, run as root (or by using sudo:)
    $ dpkg --purge remove deluge-torrent

Now install the latest version (and check out the additional notes).

==========================
Additional Notes:
==========================

1) On some distributions, boost libraries are  renamed to have "-mt" at the end 
(boost_thread_mt instead of boost_thread, for example), the "mt"  indicating 
"multithreaded". In some cases it appears the distros lack symlinks to connect 
things. The solution is to either add symlinks from the short names to those 
with "-mt", or to alter setup.py to look for the "-mt" versions.
 
2) After upgrading your Deluge installation, it may fail to start.  If this 
happens to you, you need to remove your ~/.config/deluge directory to allow 
Deluge to rebuild it's configuration file.
