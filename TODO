* Hook gtkui preferences up in the preferences dialog
* Add 'set config functions' in the core so when config options change the
    appropriate function will be called to 'apply' those changes.  This type of
    system may need to be added to the gtkui as well.
* Status icons for the torrentview
* Have the ui better handle not being able to connect to the daemon.
* Mainwindow state saving.. Size, location, vpane position, etc..
* System tray icon
* Add state saving to listview.. this includes saving column size and position.
* Queue plugin 'apply_queue' stuff.. Just finishing the queue plugin and it's
    intended functionality.
* Add plugin list and the ability to load/unload them from the preferences
    dialog.
* Have core keep track of which plugins are activated or not, so it only loads
    those on start-up.
* Have the UI request a list of activated plugins on start-up so it nows which
    plugins to load.
* Figure out easy way for user-made plugins to add i18n support.
* Change the menubar.py gtkui component to menus.py and add support for plugins
    to add menuitems to the torrentmenu in an easy way.
* Create a new status icon.. a red alert icon to show there is an error with
    the torrent.. ie, disk full alert and stuff like that..
* Add the tracker responses to the torrent details
