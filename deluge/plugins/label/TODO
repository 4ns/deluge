*grey bars in sidebar are ugly
*label sub-menu is broken on 1'st popup.
*replacing/restoring the sidebar model is a hack
*config should save a label on bottom ok-button, not a seperate save-button per label
*filters : add "Traffic" , use label-core for filtering ; needs hooks in torrentview.
*torrentview: bugs/hacks in adding and removing columns
*webui is functional but not polished.
*move_torrent_to is not implemeted
*no client-side validation (could be solved by a ui.aclient exception-plugin)
