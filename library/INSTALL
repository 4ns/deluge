================================= 
Installation of pytorrent
=================================

Compile:         python setup.py build
Compile&install: sudo python setup.py install

setup_naive.py is the actual setup file. This is where you would change libraries, if you need to (see notes later on). setup.py is a wrapper for the 'naive' version; it deals with what are currently bugs in the Python distutils - in particular, the lack of an ability to remove some compiler flags. The wrapper code lets us change whatever flags we want.

Dependencies to compile (written as Ubuntu packages): python, libboost-filesystem1.33.1, libboost-date-time1.33.1, libboost-program-options1.33.1, libboost-regex1.33.1, libboost-thread1.33.1, libc6-dev, zlib1g-dev

May also depend on (not sure): python-dev, and -dev packages for all boost libs

Makefile.libtorrent-only.* are the makefiles from libtorrent, copied as it. They don't refer to pytorrent, and probably won't work in the current directory structure. However, they may help people know what dependencies etc. are needed

If you find mistakes here, please notify me on the project page, www.deluge-torrent.org. Thank you.
