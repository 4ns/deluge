You may compile the code with the script 'makeit'. The
script 'installit' will install the pytorrent_core package
to the central package store, so that it can be imported inside
pytorrent.py (which is required).

Currently the scripts do NOT copy pytorrent.py to the central
package store, as Deluge imports pytorrent.py by "import
library.pytorrent"

You can check whether pytorrent works by running

python test.py

This does a simple torrent download. Note that the torrent file
used for this test may have expired, so you may need to use a
current one.
