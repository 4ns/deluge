Flood
=================

You may compile the code with the script 'makeit'. The
script 'installit' will install the flood_core package
to the central package store, so that it can be imported inside
flood.py (which is required).

Currently the scripts do NOT copy flood.py to the central
package store, as Deluge imports flood.py by "import
library.flood"

You can check whether flood works by running

python test.py

This does a simple torrent download. Note that the torrent file
used for this test may have expired, so you may need to use a
current one.
