Installation
============

Basically you should just run

python setup.py install



Notes:

1) On some distributions, boost libraries are renamed to have "-mt" at the end (boost_thread_mt instead of boost_thread, for example), the "mt" indicating "multithreaded". In some cases it appears the distros lack symlinks to connect things. The solution is to either add symlinks from the short names to those with "-mt", or to alter setup.py to look for the "-mt" versions.
