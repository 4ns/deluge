NOTE: Deluge 0.5.1 and newer uses an unstable build of libtorrent.  This build differs 
from a clean libtorrent source checkout and has been hacked in order to get it 
to work properly with Deluge.  As a result, Deluge will likely not build 
properly against a vanilla libtorrent 0.12 installation or a nightly build of
libtorrent 0.13.  It is recommended that you build against our included 
libtorrent, as our build will not conflict with any installed libtorrent.
